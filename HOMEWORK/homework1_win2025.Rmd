### Exercises 

1. Jean d'Alembert, an eighteenth century French mathematician, was
once asked the following question: What is the probability of getting at least one head in two tosses of a fair coin. d'Alembert answered 2/3, his argument being that there are
3 possible outcomes, H, TH, and TT, two of which (H and TH) satisfy the description
"at least one head". Discuss his reasoning and why it is erroneous. 


2. A new no-frills airline runs a commuter shuttle service using a
refurbished World War II bomber. The two‚Äêpropeller plane will fly if both
of its engines function. Suppose $A$ defines the event that the port engine fails, and B is the event that the starboard engine fails. 

    We are given that $P(A) = 0.10$, $P(B)=0.15$, and $P(A \cap B)=0.015$. What is the probability that the plane will complete its next flight safely?  (Show your steps and be sure to cite relevant results from our notes to justify them. )

3.  For two events $A$ and $B$ with $P(A)=0.5$ and $P(B)=0.8$, what are the largest and smallest possible values for $P(A \cap B)$? Be sure to show your work and explain the steps, referring to results from our notes.


4.  Three events $A$, $B$ and $C$ are defined in a sample space. Show that 
$$P(A \cup B \cup C) \leq P(A) + P(B) + P(C).$$ 
   
a. If we copy and paste this question into ChatGPT, you get the answer shown in the file `HW1problem4-chatgpt.pdf` in the COURSEMATERIALS/HOMEWORK folder.  Explain what's wrong with the proof.


b. Now work out the correct proof. Be sure to show your steps and refer to results/theorems from our notes.

    *Hint* Define $E = B \cup C$. 
    
c. Suppose we are given that $P(A) = 0.2, P(B) = 0.1$ and $P(C) = 0.3$. What is the smallest possible value for $P\left((A \cup B \cup C)^c \right)$?
