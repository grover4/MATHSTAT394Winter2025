```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}

acceptance <- pbinom(q=3, size=10, prob=2/3) # P(X\leq 3)

```

The probability of acceptance is `r round(acceptance, 5)`.

```{r}
set.seed (131) 

reps <- 1000

x <- rbinom(n = reps, size = 10, prob = 2/3)

sum(x <= 3)/reps
```


This is not a solution to the exercise, is is extra code that you are not responsible to understand. But it provides the visualization of the Law of Large Numbers I was describing in class.

```{r}
set.seed(131)

reps <- seq(100, 1e7, 1e6)
ratios <- c()

for (i in 1:length(reps)) { x <- rbinom(n=reps[i], size=10, prob=2/3)
                            ratios[i] <-  sum(x<=3)/reps[i] }  # generate reps of our binomial rv

ggplot(mapping = aes(reps, ratios)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=acceptance, color='red')
```
