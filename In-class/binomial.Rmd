1. Free throw Freddy is a 80% shooter which means the probability he makes a shot is 0.8. Suppose he takes 20 shots during a game. 

a. Find the probability that he makes at least 90% of his shots. 

b. Make a probability histogram of $X \sim Binom(20, 0.8)$. How would you describe the shape of this distribution?

c. In class we saw that the probability that he makes at least 90% of his shots when shooting 10 times is `r 1- pbinom(q = 8, size = 10, prob = 0.8)`,  which is larger than the number in part a. How might you explain this?
